## Raising issues

If you have identified a problem or have a feature request, we would love to hear about it.

Search the [list of issues](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-eclipse-tools/issues) to see if your issue has already been raised. Also visit our [troubleshooting page](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/mdt-vsc-troubleshooting). If you do not see your issue in either of these places, go ahead and [open a new one](https://github.com/microclimate-dev2ops/microclimate-vscode-tools/issues/new).

Please provide context so that we can understand the problem and try to recreate the issue. Instructions for uploading the logs are available on the [troubleshooting page](https://microclimate-dev2ops.github.io/mdteclipsetroubleshooting).
