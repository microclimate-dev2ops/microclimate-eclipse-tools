display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. <br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License. <br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in

BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>
