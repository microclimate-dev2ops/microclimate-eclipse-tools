# This file is used by prereqs.xml to determine where to put prereq jars after they are downloaded.
# Each prereq jar gets copied into the dependant plugin's lib/ dir after ivy finishes downloading.
# If you're adding new dependencies, be sure to also add them to product-prereqs.xml so they are downloaded.
